üìñ About C Language
C is a general-purpose programming language developed by Dennis Ritchie at Bell Labs in 1972. Known for its efficiency and control over system resources, C has been the foundation for many modern programming languages like C++, Java, and Python. C is commonly used in operating systems, hardware drivers, and low-level programming, making it an essential language for developers to learn.
